# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the BIPL Lab.

## Graduate students

Prof. Zhou heads the Applied Algorithms and AI (AAAI) Theme and leads the Biomedical Image Processing Lab at University of Leicester. He was the Director of MSc Programme (2018-19), and is the Coordinator of MSc Distance Learning (Informatics), PGR Tutor and a Member of Research Committee at Informatics. Prior to this appointment, he worked as Reader (1/2018-3/2020) at University of Leicester, and Lecturer (9/2012-12/2017) at the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University Belfast (QUB). He is a visiting scholar of QUB.

If you are interested, please contact Prof. Zhou directly using the details on his [UoL profile page](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/huiyu-zhou).

## Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Fundamental understanding and modelling of biomedical signals;
- Application-driven development in collaboration with professionals in medicine and biology.   

If you are interested, please contact Prof. Zhou directly using the details on his [UoL profile page](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/huiyu-zhou).
